# Financial Data Analysis and Visualization of Loan Applications

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Financial Data Analysis and Visualization project! In this repository, you will find the necessary resources and code to conduct a comprehensive analysis of loan application data provided by "Bank X." The objective is to extract meaningful insights and visualize relationships within the data, empowering "Bank X" to make informed decisions about their loan approval process.

## Datasets

The project utilizes several CSV files containing essential data for analysis. Due to the large size of these files, they are not included in this repository. You can download the dataset as a zip file from the following link:
